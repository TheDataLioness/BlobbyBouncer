Blobbybouncer is a platformer game, you'll be Blobby!
Blobby is a slime-like creature who lives in a candy world.
You'll need to make him bounce and move through the world as quickly as possible. 
You can go to the left by using: [ LEFT ARROW KEY ] OR [ LEFT JOYSTICK TO THE LEFT ]
You can go to the right by using: [ RIGHT ARROW KEY ] OR [ LEFT JOYSTICK TO THE RIGHT ]
You can hold jump by pressing down: [ SPACE ] OR [ JOYSTICK BUTTON A ]
You can jump by releasing: [ SPACE ] OR [ JOYSTICK BUTTON A ]

With jumping there is an unique mechanic.
When holding the jump button you aren't be able to move around.
This is because Blobby is flat against the ground preparing for the jump.


Inside of the game are a few "tile" mechanics that will be explained via a mini tutorial level.


Also implemented a small easter egg. We all know the Konami code off course!
Use that code in the main menu via your keyboard and you'll see what happens in-game.

Have fun!
